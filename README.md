## OVERVIEW
**An Unwavering Feeling**

How many of us have moved into a new community and feel like we’re missing out on the best parts about it? Sure, we may wave to our neighbors when we see them, maintain our living spaces, and see others at the mailboxes but still we feel like total strangers within it. Maybe you do want to be more involved in your community but struggle on the best way to accomplish that. Corner can help you with that.

Corner is a new app where people can come together within their own communities and participate in local happenings with ease. It allows you to join in on the conversation.

## PROBLEM

Moving into a new neighborhood isn’t easy. Whether you are moving into a new apartment or a new house, you are also moving into a new community with new neighbors around you. That can come with new challenges as well, and some people may not know where to start. They look to local groups within the community as a way to connect and discover new ways to enjoy their new home. Depending on where they live, their local board or management group may not provide such a platform for residents to be a part of. What better way to ease the transition into a new neighborhood than to bring together all the groups and people who are wanting to connect together. 

## SOLUTION

The solution I came up with was a web app specific to communities and the people who live and work within them. I wanted to present a platform that would make users feel secure in the knowledge that their information was safe and that their community was there to support them. The idea was to standardize a platform that gave users, whether residents or management, the ability to connect with one another, access important documents, and share community information. A new user needs to have all the tools and information necessary to successfully become a part of their community. 

That is where Corner comes in.
